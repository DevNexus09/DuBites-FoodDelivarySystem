# DuBites - Food Delivery System üçî

A simple, console-based food delivery system built with Java. This project simulates the core functionalities of a food ordering application, allowing for the management of users, restaurants, and orders directly from the command line.

## ‚ú® Features

* **User Management:** Create and manage user accounts.
* **Restaurant Listings:** View a list of available restaurants.
* **Order Processing:** Place and track food orders.
* **Data Persistence:** User, restaurant, and order data are saved locally using `.dat` files.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Language:** Java

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (e.g., JDK 11 or newer).
* An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse, or just a command-line terminal.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/DevNexus09/DuBites-FoodDelivarySystem.git](https://github.com/DevNexus09/DuBites-FoodDelivarySystem.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd DuBites-FoodDelivarySystem
    ```

3.  **Compile the Java source files:**
    If you are in the `src` directory, you can compile the project using `javac`.
    ```bash
    # Navigate to the source directory
    cd src

    # Compile all .java files
    javac *.java
    ```
    *(Note: The exact command might vary based on your project structure and main class.)*

### Usage

1.  **Run the application:**
    After compiling, run the main class from the terminal.
    ```bash
    # Replace 'Main' with the name of your main class file
    java Main
    ```

2.  Follow the on-screen prompts in the console to navigate the application, register as a new user, browse restaurants, and place an order.

## üìù Future Improvements

* [ ] Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) using JavaFX or Swing.
* [ ] Add more detailed restaurant menus.
* [ ] Integrate a proper database instead of `.dat` files for more robust data management.
